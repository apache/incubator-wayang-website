It not only selects the most suitable processing engine for each task, but also empowers users to execute a single task across multiple platforms. This capability is achieved through an extensible set of graph transformations applied to the Apache Wayang plan, which identifies alternative execution plans that potentially offer better performance. These alternative plans are then evaluated using platform-specific cost models, which can either be user-defined or learned from historical data. These cost models are parameterized based on the underlying hardware configuration, such as the number of computing nodes for distributed operations."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"scalable-ml-ml4all",children:"Scalable ML (ML4All)"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"ML4all is part of Wayang, enhancing machine learning workflows.
