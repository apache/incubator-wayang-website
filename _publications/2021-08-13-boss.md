The following video shows a hands-on tutorial of Apache Wayang presented in the BOSS workshop 2021. The workshop, which is held in conjunction with the top-tier conference in data management (VLDB),  gives a deep-dive introduction to active open-source systems and this year was focused on the interoperability among big data systems. Our tutorial, after giving a brief overview of Wayang’s goal and architecture, focuses on live demonstration of various Wayang features. First, we give a WordCount example where the basic API is explained. Then, via K-means and SGD examples we show how a user can use iterations and how she can benefit by letting Wayang selecting the platforms to execute these tasks. Finally, we show how one can easily switch from batch processing to streaming via the WordCount task.
