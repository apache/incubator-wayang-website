            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intro">Intro<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/Apache%20Kafka%20meets%20Apache%20Wayang#intro" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Intro" title="Direct link to Intro">​</a></h2>
<p>This article is the first of a four part series about federated data analysis using Apache Wayang.
The first article starts with an introduction of a typical data colaboration scenario which will emerge in our digital future.</p>
<p>In part two and three we will share a summary of our Apache Kafka client implementation for Apache Wayang.
We started with the Java Platform (part 2) and the Apache Spark implementation follows (W.I.P.) in part three.</p>
<p>The use case behind this work is an imaginary data collaboration scenario.
We see this example and the demand for a solution already in many places.<br>
<!-- -->For us this is motivation enough to propose a solution.
This would also allow us to do more local data processing, and businesses can stop moving data around the world, but rather care about data locality while they expose and share specific information to others by using data federation.
This reduces complexity of data management and cost dramatically.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we illustrate a cross organizational data sharing scenario from the finance sector soon.
This analysis pattern will also be relevant in the context of data analysis along supply chains, another typical example where data from many stakeholder together is needed but never managed in one place, for good reasons.</p>
<p>Data federation can help us to unlock the hidden value of all those isolated data lakes.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-cross-organizational-data-sharing-scenario">A cross organizational data sharing scenario<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/Apache%20Kafka%20meets%20Apache%20Wayang#a-cross-organizational-data-sharing-scenario" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A cross organizational data sharing scenario" title="Direct link to A cross organizational data sharing scenario">​</a></h2>
<p>Our goal is the implementation of a cross organization decentralized data processing scenario, in which protected local data should be processed in combination with public data from public sources in a collaborative manner.
Instead of copying all data into a central data lake or a central data platform we decided to use federated analytics.
Apache Wayang is the tool we work with.
In our case, the public data is hosted on publicly available websites or data pods.
A client can use the HTTP(S) protocol to read the data which is given in a well defined format.
For simplicity we decided to use CSV format.
When we look into the data of each participant we have a different perspective.</p>
<p>Our processing procedure should calculate a particular metric on the <em>local data</em> of each participant.
An example of such a metric is the average spending of all users on a particular product category per month.
This can vary from partner to partner, hence, we want to be able to calculate a peer-group comparison so that each partner can see its own metric compared with a global average calculated from contributions by all partners.
Such a process requires global averaging and local averaging.
And due to governance constraints, we can’t bring all raw data together in one place.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to use Apache Wayang for this purpose.
We simplify the procedure and split it into two phases.
Phase one is the process, which allows each participant to calculate the local metrics.
This requires only local data. The second phase requires data from all collaborating partners.
The monthly sum and counter values per partner and category are needed in one place by all other parties.
Hence, the algorithm of the first phase stores the local results locally, and the contributions to the global results in an externally accessible Kafka topic.
We assume this is done by each of the partners.</p>
<p>Now we have a scenario, in which an Apache Wayang process must be able to read data from multiple Apache Kafka topics from multiple Apache Kafka clusters but finally writes into a single Kafka topic, which then can be accessed by all the participating clients.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="images/image-1.png" src="https://wayang.apache.org/assets/images/image-1-9cc35d5aea2b867d7e5759a96bd02334.png" width="904" height="550" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The illustration shows the data flows in such a scenario.
Jobs with red border are executed by the participants in isolation within their own data processing environments.
But they share some of the data, using publicly accessible Kafka topics, marked by A. Job 4 is the Apache Wayang job in our focus: here we intent to read data from 3 different source systems, and write results into a fourth system (marked as B), which can be accesses by all participants again.</p>
<p>With this in mind we want to implement an Apache Wayang application which implements the illustrated <em>Job 4</em>.
Since as of today, there is now <em>KafkaSource</em> and <em>KafkaSink</em> available in Apache Wayang, an implementation of both will be our first step.
Our assumption is, that in the beginning, there won’t be much data.</p>
<p>Apache Spark is not required to cope with the load, but we expect, that in the future, a single Java application would not be able to handle our workload.
Hence, we want to utilize the Apache Wayang abstraction over multiple processing platforms, starting with Java.
Later, we want to switch to Apache Spark.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The third part of this article series is an activity log.
Motivated by the learnings from last time, I stated implementing a Kafka Source component and a Kafka Sink component for the Apache Spark platform in Apache Wayang.
In our previous article we shared the results of the work on the frist Apache Kafka integration using the Java Platform.</p>
<p>Let's see how it goes this time with Apache Spark.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-goal-of-this-implementation">The goal of this implementation<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/kafka-meets-wayang-2#the-goal-of-this-implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The goal of this implementation" title="Direct link to The goal of this implementation">​</a></h2>
<p>We want to process data from Apache Kafka topics, which are hosted on Confluent cloud.
In our example scenario, the data is available in multiple different clusters, in different regions and owned by different organizations.</p>
<p>We assume, that the operator of our job has been granted appropriate permissions, and the topic owner already provided the configuration properties, including access coordinates and credentials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="images/image-1.png" src="https://wayang.apache.org/assets/images/image-1-9cc35d5aea2b867d7e5759a96bd02334.png" width="904" height="550" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This illustration has already been introduced in part one.
We focus on <strong>Job 4</strong> in the image and start to implement it.
This time we expect the processing load to be higher so that we want to utilize the scalability capabilities of Apache Spark.</p>
<p>Again, we start with a <strong>WayangContext</strong>, as shown by examples in the Wayang code repository.</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">WayangContext wayangContext = new WayangContext().with(Spark.basicPlugin());</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>We simply switched the backend system towards Apache Spark by using the <em>WayangContext</em> with <em>Spark.basicPlugin()</em>.
The <strong>JavaPlanBuilder</strong> and all other logic of our example job won't be touched.</p>
<p>In order to make this working we will now implement the Mappings and the Operators for the Apache Spark platform module.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation-of-input--and-output-operators">Implementation of Input- and Output Operators<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/kafka-meets-wayang-2#implementation-of-input--and-output-operators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation of Input- and Output Operators" title="Direct link to Implementation of Input- and Output Operators">​</a></h2>
<p>We reuse the Kafka Source and Kafka Sink components which have been created for the JavaKafkaSource and JavaKafkaSink.
Hence we work with Wayang's Java API.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1 – Wayang execution plan with abstract operators</strong></p>
<p>Since the <em>JavaPlanBuilder</em> already exposes the function for selecting a Kafka topic as source
and the <em>DataQuantaBuilder</em> class exposes the <em>writeKafkaTopic</em> function we can move on quickly.</p>
<p>Remember, in this API layer we use the Scala programming language, but we utilize the Java classes, implemented in the layer below.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2 – Wiring between Platform Abstraction and Implementation</strong></p>
<p>As in the case with the Java Platform, in the second layer we build a bridge between the WayangContext and the PlanBuilders, which work together with DataQuanta and the DataQuantaBuilder.</p>
<p>We must provide the mapping between the abstract components and the specific implementations in this layer.</p>
<p>Therefore, the mappings package in project <strong>wayang-platforms/wayang-spark</strong> has a class <em>Mappings</em> in which
our <em>KafkaTopicSinkMapping</em> and <em>KafkaTopicSourceMapping</em> will be registered.</p>
<p>Again, these classes allow the Apache Wayang framework to use the Java implementation of the KafkaTopicSource component (and KafkaTopicSink respectively).</p>
<p>While the Wayang execution plan uses the higher abstractions, here on the “platform level” we have to link the specific implementation for the target platform.
In this case this leads to an Apache Spark job, running on a Spark cluster which is set up by the Apache Wayang framework using the logical components of the execution plan, and the Apache Spark configuration provided at runtime.</p>
<p>A mapping links an operator implementation to the abstraction used in an execution plan.
We define two new mappings for our purpose, namely KafkaTopicSourceMapping, and KafkaTopicSinkMapping, both could be reused from last round.</p>
<p>For the Spark platform we simply replace the occurences of <em>JavaPlatform</em> with <em>SparkPlatform</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we create an implementation of the <em>SparkKafkaTopicSource</em> and <em>SparkKafkaTopicSink</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 3 – Input/Output Connector Layer</strong></p>
<p>Let's quickly recap, how does Apache Spark interacts with Apache Kafka?</p>
<p>There is already an integration which gives us a DataSet using the Spark SQL framework.
For Spark Streaming, there is also a Kafka integration using the <em>SparkSession</em>'s <em>readStream()</em> function.
Kafka client properties are provided as key value pairs <em>k</em> and <em>v</em> by using the <em>option( k, v )</em> function.
For writing into a topic, we can use the <em>writeStream()</em> function.
But from a first look, it seems to be not the best fit.</p>
<p>Another approach is possible.
We can use simple RDDs to process data previously consumed from Apache Kafka.
This is a more low-level approach compared to using Datasets with Spark Structured Streaming,
and it typically involves using the Kafka RDD API provided by Spark.</p>
<p>This approach is less common with newer versions of Spark, as Structured Streaming provides a higher-level abstraction that simplifies stream processing.
However, we might need that approach for the integration with Apache Wayang.</p>
<p>For now, we will focus on the lower level approach and plan to consume data from Kafka using a Kafka client, and then
we parallelize the records in an RDD.</p>
<p>This allows us to reuse <em>KafkaTopicSource</em> and <em>KafkaTopicSink</em> classes we built last time.
Those were made specifically for a simple non parallel Java program, using one Consumer and one Producer.</p>
<p>The selected approach does not yet fully take advantage from Spark's parallelism at load time.
For higher loads and especially for streaming processing we would have to investigate another approache, using a <em>SparkStreamingContext</em>, but this is out of scope for now.</p>
<p>Since we can't reuse the <em>JavaKafkaTopicSource</em> and <em>JavaKafkaTopicSink</em> we rather implement <em>SparkKafkaTopicSource</em> and <em>SparkKafkaTopicSink</em> based on given <em>SparkTextFileSource</em> and <em>SparkTextFileSink</em> which both cary all needed RDD specific logic.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/kafka-meets-wayang-2#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2>
<p>As expected, the integration of Apache Spark with Apache Wayang was no magic, thanks to a fluent API design and a well structured architecture of Apache Wayang.
We could easily follow the pattern we have worked out in the previous exercise.</p>
<p>But a bunch of much more interesting work will follow next.
More testing, more serialization schemes, and Kafka Schema Registry support should follow, and full parallelization as well.</p>
<p>The code has been submitted to the Apache Wayang repository.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outlook">Outlook<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/kafka-meets-wayang-2#outlook" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Outlook" title="Direct link to Outlook">​</a></h2>
<p>The next part of the article series will cover the real world example as described in image 1.
We will show how analysts and developers can use the Apache Kafka integration for Apache Wayang to solve cross organizational collaboration issues.
Therefore, we will bring all puzzles together, and show the full implementation of the multi organizational data collaboration use case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have been asked several times about the difference between Apache Wayang and Presto/Trino. In this blog post, we will clarify the main differences and how they impact various applications and use cases.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-distinctions">Key Distinctions<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/wayang-vs-trino#key-distinctions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Distinctions" title="Direct link to Key Distinctions">​</a></h2>
<p>Trino/Presto is a <strong>query engine</strong> for <strong>distributed SQL query processing</strong>. It is composed of a coordinator and multiple workers. The coordinator consists of a query optimizer and a scheduler, while the workers are responsible for performing the necessary query processing. Data is fetched from external systems via a Connector API, i.e., Trino/Presto supports <a href="https://trino.io/ecosystem/data-source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple data sources</a>. Notably,query processing is is conducted exclusively by Trino/Presto workers, not the external systems.</p>
<p>In contrast, Wayang is a <strong>middleware</strong> for <strong>integrating diverse data platforms</strong>, including but not limited to query engines. This means that Wayang leverages the processing capabilities of the underlying data platforms to complete a given job, with no actual query processing taking place within Wayang itself.</p>
<p>Below you can graphically see the difference between the two systems. Note that not all available data sources or data platforms are illustrated for simplicity reasons.</p>
<br>
<img width="90%" alt="Wayang" src="https://wayang.apache.org/img/blog/wayang-architecture.png" title="Wayang">
<br>
<br>
<img width="90%" alt="Trino" src="https://wayang.apache.org/img/blog/trino-architecture.png" title="Trino">
<br>
<p>I hope this makes it clear now. <br>
In fact, Trino can be easily plugged to Wayang as a platform and be seamlessly integrated with other data platforms, as shown below.</p>
<img width="75%" alt="Trino" src="https://wayang.apache.org/img/blog/wayang-with-trino.png">

<p>Wayang brings several benefits thanks to its integration layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seamless integration of SQL query engines with ML and other data analysis systems within a single job, eliminating the need to materialize intermediate results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users are freed from the task of specifying the query engines for an application if they desire. By submitting their Wayang job, the cross-platform optimizer can automatically determine the best data platform to use for improved performance or cost savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayang facilitates cross-platform data processing by utilizing multiple data platforms to execute a query for a single job, optimizing performance and cost efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data does not have to be transferred outside their original location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/wayang-vs-trino#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>Trino is a distributed SQL query engine which performs all the query processing of an input SQL query in a distributed manner. Wayang, on the other hand, is a data platform integrator which can automatically determine which data platform(s) is best suited for an application.</p>

Kafka client properties are provided as key value pairs <em>k</em> and <em>v</em> by using the <em>option( k, v )</em> function.
For writing into a topic, we can use the <em>writeStream()</em> function.
But from a first look, it seems to be not the best fit.</p>
<p>Another approach is possible.
We can use simple RDDs to process data previously consumed from Apache Kafka.
This is a more low-level approach compared to using Datasets with Spark Structured Streaming,
and it typically involves using the Kafka RDD API provided by Spark.</p>
<p>This approach is less common with newer versions of Spark, as Structured Streaming provides a higher-level abstraction that simplifies stream processing.
However, we might need that approach for the integration with Apache Wayang.</p>
<p>For now, we will focus on the lower level approach and plan to consume data from Kafka using a Kafka client, and then
we parallelize the records in an RDD.</p>
<p>This allows us to reuse <em>KafkaTopicSource</em> and <em>KafkaTopicSink</em> classes we built last time.
Those were made specifically for a simple non parallel Java program, using one Consumer and one Producer.</p>
<p>The selected approach does not yet fully take advantage from Spark's parallelism at load time.
For higher loads and especially for streaming processing we would have to investigate another approache, using a <em>SparkStreamingContext</em>, but this is out of scope for now.</p>
<p>Since we can't reuse the <em>JavaKafkaTopicSource</em> and <em>JavaKafkaTopicSink</em> we rather implement <em>SparkKafkaTopicSource</em> and <em>SparkKafkaTopicSink</em> based on given <em>SparkTextFileSource</em> and <em>SparkTextFileSink</em> which both cary all needed RDD specific logic.</p>

<p>As expected, the integration of Apache Spark with Apache Wayang was no magic, thanks to a fluent API design and a well structured architecture of Apache Wayang.
We could easily follow the pattern we have worked out in the previous exercise.</p>
<p>But a bunch of much more interesting work will follow next.
More testing, more serialization schemes, and Kafka Schema Registry support should follow, and full parallelization as well.</p>
<p>The code has been submitted to the Apache Wayang repository.</p>

<p>The next part of the article series will cover the real world example as described in image 1.
We will show how analysts and developers can use the Apache Kafka integration for Apache Wayang to solve cross organizational collaboration issues.
Therefore, we will bring all puzzles together, and show the full implementation of the multi organizational data collaboration use case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This article is the first of a four part series about federated data analysis using Apache Wayang.
The first article starts with an introduction of a typical data colaboration scenario which will emerge in our digital future.</p>
<p>In part two and three we will share a summary of our Apache Kafka client implementation for Apache Wayang.
We started with the Java Platform (part 2) and the Apache Spark implementation follows (W.I.P.) in part three.</p>
<p>The use case behind this work is an imaginary data collaboration scenario.
We see this example and the demand for a solution already in many places.<br>
<!-- -->For us this is motivation enough to propose a solution.
This would also allow us to do more local data processing, and businesses can stop moving data around the world, but rather care about data locality while they expose and share specific information to others by using data federation.
This reduces complexity of data management and cost dramatically.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we illustrate a cross organizational data sharing scenario from the finance sector soon.
This analysis pattern will also be relevant in the context of data analysis along supply chains, another typical example where data from many stakeholder together is needed but never managed in one place, for good reasons.</p>
<p>Data federation can help us to unlock the hidden value of all those isolated data lakes.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-cross-organizational-data-sharing-scenario">A cross organizational data sharing scenario<a href="https://wayang.apache.org/blog/kafka-meets-wayang-1#a-cross-organizational-data-sharing-scenario" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A cross organizational data sharing scenario" title="Direct link to A cross organizational data sharing scenario">​</a></h2>
<p>Our goal is the implementation of a cross organization decentralized data processing scenario, in which protected local data should be processed in combination with public data from public sources in a collaborative manner.
Instead of copying all data into a central data lake or a central data platform we decided to use federated analytics.
Apache Wayang is the tool we work with.
In our case, the public data is hosted on publicly available websites or data pods.
A client can use the HTTP(S) protocol to read the data which is given in a well defined format.
For simplicity we decided to use CSV format.
When we look into the data of each participant we have a different perspective.</p>
<p>Our processing procedure should calculate a particular metric on the <em>local data</em> of each participant.
An example of such a metric is the average spending of all users on a particular product category per month.
This can vary from partner to partner, hence, we want to be able to calculate a peer-group comparison so that each partner can see its own metric compared with a global average calculated from contributions by all partners.
Such a process requires global averaging and local averaging.
And due to governance constraints, we can’t bring all raw data together in one place.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to use Apache Wayang for this purpose.
We simplify the procedure and split it into two phases.
Phase one is the process, which allows each participant to calculate the local metrics.
This requires only local data. The second phase requires data from all collaborating partners.
The monthly sum and counter values per partner and category are needed in one place by all other parties.
Hence, the algorithm of the first phase stores the local results locally, and the contributions to the global results in an externally accessible Kafka topic.
We assume this is done by each of the partners.</p>
<p>Now we have a scenario, in which an Apache Wayang process must be able to read data from multiple Apache Kafka topics from multiple Apache Kafka clusters but finally writes into a single Kafka topic, which then can be accessed by all the participating clients.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="images/image-1.png" src="https://wayang.apache.org/assets/images/image-1-9cc35d5aea2b867d7e5759a96bd02334.png" width="904" height="550" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The illustration shows the data flows in such a scenario.
Jobs with red border are executed by the participants in isolation within their own data processing environments.
But they share some of the data, using publicly accessible Kafka topics, marked by A. Job 4 is the Apache Wayang job in our focus: here we intent to read data from 3 different source systems, and write results into a fourth system (marked as B), which can be accesses by all participants again.</p>
<p>With this in mind we want to implement an Apache Wayang application which implements the illustrated <em>Job 4</em>.
Since as of today, there is now <em>KafkaSource</em> and <em>KafkaSink</em> available in Apache Wayang, an implementation of both will be our first step.
Our assumption is, that in the beginning, there won’t be much data.</p>
<p>Apache Spark is not required to cope with the load, but we expect, that in the future, a single Java application would not be able to handle our workload.
Hence, we want to utilize the Apache Wayang abstraction over multiple processing platforms, starting with Java.
Later, we want to switch to Apache Spark.</p>]]></content:encoded>
