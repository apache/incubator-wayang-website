The Apache Wayang team happily welcomes contributors and supporters of this nice Podling.

Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome to Wayang code, website, documentation, and everything else! Inside the documentation, you can find How to contribute with more details. The Team is waiting for you join to this Podling.  


# Mailing List

Mailing list is where we discuss in public and keep everything tracked. You are welcomed to subscribe it if you wish:

- To be informed about bug reports or feature requests. 
- To discuss developing plans or specific issues. 
- To offer helps to those who ask questions by email.
- Give us ideas to make Wayang better for you and all the community.

The emails where you can get subscribe are:
* [dev@wayang.apache.org](mailto:dev@wayang.apache.org) holds other general discussions.
* [commits@wayang.apache.org ](mailto:commits@wayang.apache.org )focuses on the commit logs.

## How to subscribe to a mailing list

Send an email without any contents or subject to LISTNAME-subscribe@wayang.apache.org. (replace LISTNAME with dev, commits, ..)
    Wait till you receive an email with the subject “confirm subscribe to LISTNAME@wayang.apache.org”. Reply to that email, without editing the subject or including any contents
    Wait till you receive an email with the subject “WELCOME to LISTNAME@wayang.apache.org”.

If you send us an email with a code snippet, make sure that:

* you do not link to files in external services as such files can change, get deleted, or the link might break and thus make an archived email thread useless 
* you paste text instead of screenshots of text 
* you keep formatting when pasting code in order to keep the code readable 
* there are enough import statements to avoid ambiguities
* if you are using some platform, please specify the version
