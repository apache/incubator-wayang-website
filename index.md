    THE API FOR BIGATA </br></br>
    CROSS-PLATFORM DATA PROCESSING 
  text:   |
    Apache Wayang is a API first system designed to fully support cross-platform data processing: Wayang enables users to run data analytics over multiple data processing platforms, whithout changing the native code. </br>
    Wayang provides an abstraction on top of existing platforms in order to run data processing and analytic tasks on top of any set of platforms. As a result, users can focus on the logics of their applications rather on the intricacies of the underlying platforms.

  title: Why is Apache Wayang faster as other, modern frameworks?
  text: |
   Apache Wayang uses internal optimization patterns to detect the best possible combination of computation and nodes. We know, just adding more nodes into a cluster doesn't mean more speed; each additional node has several tradeoffs, be it shuffle or communication bottlenecks.
   Apache Wayang understands the UDF's and optimizes the function for the underlying processing platform. It also uses small JVM instances to reduce the operational overhead when processing a reduced number of data points.
